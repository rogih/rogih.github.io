Welcome to my research page. Below you will find a list of my publications and working papers as well as links to code(take a look at my project page).

My research interests include time series analysis, robust statistics, multivariate regression, principal component analysis, and computational statistics, all in a big-data setting.

Don't be afraid to contact me if you want to discuss about them or about the analysis performed. I'll be glad to help.
