  Hi there \o/ I'm Higor, a data scientist based between Paris@France and Vit√≥ria@Brazil (check the maps bellow)

I use this space to share my thoughts on a wide range of topics and techiniques that are at the intersection of statistics, data science, computer science, data engineering & software development.

I am interested in applied and theoretical aspects of time series analysis, regression analysis and high-dimension techniques.
